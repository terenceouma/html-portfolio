<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  My name is Terence Ouma and I am a startup founder for a company called Doros
  which is aspiring to be a one stop shop for everything that has to do with
  weddings. We hope to help African couples with their big days since on the
  continent most couples have to do more that oone event for their weddings.

  I have a background in Finance and worked for L'Oreal for several years as a
  financial controller. Enjoy my work there in the beginning but gre
  frustartated since it was too rigged of an environment. Felt the need to start
  my own thing. I want to learn how to code so that I can build tech products
  that people will love and use.
